# What is DevOps

DevOps is a collective body of knowledge that outlines how product owners, QA IT Operations, and InfoSec can work together.

By working towards a common goal, DevOps enables the rapid deployment of planned work into production while keeping it stable, available, and secure.

Developed by practicioners, for practitioners, DevOps is a philosophy that guides the efficient development, deployment, and operation of software.

There is no single "right" way to implement DevOps.  

> "DevOps, in a sense, is about setting up "a value delivery factory - a streamlined, "waste-free pipeline through which value "can be delivered to the business "with a predictably fast cycle time." 
> 
> --Mark Schwartz, The Art of Business Value

DevOps is a cultural movement based on human and technical interactions to improve both relationships and results.

## What DevOps is NOT

I prefer to describe things for what they are.  I think it is clearer and cleaner.  However, in my research, I've found a consistent theme where people describe what DevOps is **not**.  

* A title
* A separate team
* A single tool
* Only about culture
* Only about automation
* Anarchy/lawlessness
* A one-size-fits all strategy

It is _systems thinking_ that connects people, processess, and automation.  More than that, it is a system of systems.

## Goals of DevOps

* Smaller, more frequent Releases
* Reduced effort/risks
* Reduced cost per iteration
* The impact of any delay is reduced
* Create a culture of communication/collaboration
* Automation creates consistency and speed

## Improvement

* Time to market/value
* Business integration
* Responsiveness
* Code/deployment quality
* Productivity
* Visibility/Consistency
* Agility

# CAMS

* Culture
* Automation
* Measurement
* Sharing

**Culture** relates to the people and processes and the need to imrove communication and collaboration. Without the right culture, attempts at automation will fail.

**Automation** tools mimimize waste and improve flow. These tools include configuration management, release management, monitoring, and control.   

*Waste and **TIMWOOD**: Lean has identified seven types of waste.  They are **T**ransportation, **I**nventory, **M**otion, **W**aiting, **O**ver-processing, **O**verproduction, and **D**efects.*

**Measurement** provides details about performance.  For DevOps to increase value, you need to know what's happening inside the system.  This includes performance by people, processes, and technology.

**Sharing** is the feedback loop that creates a culture of self-reflection and improvment.  It moves organizations away from self-contained silos to one of collaboration.

# CAMS became CALMS (or CLAMS)

I have to find the source for this but, at somepoint, CAMS became CALMS.  (One YouTube video called it CLAMS. Find pearls of wisdom where you can.)

* Lean

**Lean** operations increases value by reducing/eliminating waste.

# DevOps Stakeholders

Development (Dev) includes everyone involved in creating software products and services:

* Architects
* Business representatives
* Customers
* Product managers
* Project managers
* Quality Assurance testers
* Analysts
* Suppliers

(...and more...)

Operations (Ops) includes those that are part of delivering and managing software products and services:

* Security professionals
* Systems engineers
* Systems administrators
* IT Operations engineers
* Release engineers
* Database administrators
* Network engineers
* Support professionals
* Suppliers

(...and more...)

**Important**: DevOps extends beyond software developers and IT operations.  In general, these two groups address technical problems.  DevOps, because it takes a systems-level approach, identifies people problems and uses technology to address them.

# Why does DevOps matter?

Technology, as a tool, is only a competitive advantage for a short time.  Eventually, competitors will catch up to you.

With waterfall-type projects--where a system is developed and implemented all at once--customer feedback is available only after the project is complete.

Waterfall projects also have limited release windows that, when they malfunction, can substantially delay projects and impact their potential value.

## DevOps improves IT's cadence and velocity

Continuous Delivery (CD) means that software is always in a releasable state.  This allows organiations to introduce incremental changes.

Some projects will have very rigid requirements that require waterfall-style management.  While CI/CD is not appropriate here, DevOps tools/thinking can help identify issues that might cripple the delivery/business.

## Sometimes, speed kills

Going faster can result in a reduction of quality.  

Issues need to be resolved at the source to prevent errors being passed downstream.  This can be done using:

* Version control
* Continuous Integration (CI)
* Continuous Delivery (CD)
* Automated testing
* Monitoring

# Customer focus

Every business has become a "tech business."  In the 1970s, 80s, and 90s, technology was often an after-market add-on.  That is, people brought in technology to help them with existing businesses.  Today, information technology is at the heart of business processes.  

Customers (end-users) have developed "app mentalities" and value outcomes over products.

While brand-loyalty still exists, people are more inclined to switch to a product that works and avoid those that will prevent switching from happening.

(They might never switch but they want the option.)

Time-to-value is replacing time-to-market.

Intelligent data collection must be used to shape direction.  

(Big Data, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence are finding value in datasets that might not normally be seen as intelligent.)

Customer delight is becoming more important than customer satisfaction.  

# Business value of DevOps

Organization culture is one of the strongest predictors of IT performance as well the overall performance of an organization.

Strong performers achieve or exceed:

* Quantity/quality of products/services
* Operating efficiency
* Customer delight/satisfaction
* Achieving organizational/mission goals
* Measurements that prove to customers/auditors that the organization is achieving organizational/mission goals

# The Golden Circle - Start with "Why?"

Multiple YouTube videos referenced [Simon Sinek's TED Talk about the "Golden Circle."](https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action?language=en)

Simon Sinek uses a model called The Golden Circle to explain how legendary leaders like Steve Jobs, Martin Luther King Jr., and the Wright brothers were able to inspire, rather than manipulate, in order to motivate people. 

The power of **WHY** is found in biology, not opinon.

The Golden Circle is more than a communications hierarchy. Its principles are deeply grounded in the tenets of human decision making. 

How the Golden Circle works maps perfectly with how our brain works and can be used as a guide to vastly improve leadership, corporate culture, hiring, product development, sales and marketing. 

It explains loyalty and how to create enough momentum to turn an idea into a social movement.

## What
Every organization knows what they do. These are the products that are sold or the services provided.
## How
Some organizations know how they do it. What sets your organization/product apart from the competition?
## Why
Few organizations know why they do what they do.  (As in: We've always done it that way.  It just works.  Why change?)

Making money is not a reason why; it is a result.  

An organization's *why* is its purpose, cause, or belief.

*Why* does your organization exist?

 "Making money" is not a reason why, it's a result.
 
 ## DevOps as Servant Leadership

> “The servant-leader is servant first… It begins with the natural feeling that one wants to serve, to serve first. Then conscious choice brings one to aspire to lead. That person is sharply different from one who is leader first, perhaps because of the need to assuage an unusual power drive or to acquire material possessions…The leader-first and the servant-first are two extreme types. Between them there are shadings and blends that are part of the infinite variety of human nature.
> 
> Robert K. Greenleaf, [_The Servant as Leader_](https://www.greenleaf.org/what-is-servant-leadership/)
 
 DevOps exists to serve your organization, first.
 
 # IT and DevOps
 
IT drives DevOps for the same reasons that the business does. 
 
Every business has become a "tech business."  Today, information technology is at the heart of business processes.  
Customers (end-users) have developed "app mentalities" and value outcomes over products.

While brand-loyalty still exists, people are more inclined to switch to a product that works and avoid those that will prevent switching from happening.

Time-to-value is replacing time-to-market.

Intelligent data collection must be used to shape direction.  

(Big Data, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence are finding value in datasets that might not normally be seen as intelligent.)

Customer delight is becoming more important than customer satisfaction.  

## Internal IT Challenges

* Information technology move faster without sacrificing quality.
* Prior investments (sunk costs) sometimes prevent change as management seeks to maximize their investment.
* Silos (independent teams) constrain value while seeking autonomy.

There was a time that information technology was an add-on to existing businesses like an after-market option to a house or a car.  There was a struggle to allign/integrate IT departments with the business needs.

Ever tried to add a sunroof to a house/car?  It's expensive and prone to defects.

Today, IT is at the heart of businesses.  

Silos in organizations continue to exist.  DevOps can create bridges between them to increase/improve value to the organization.  

## The traditional IT mindset

Traditionally, the IT mindset views failure as a negative.  If you're not winning, you're losing.

The DevOps mindset uses experiements and trials as learning activities.  Failure is accepted as long as a lesson is learned and applied to future attempts.

## A blend of development and operations

DevOps is a response to the disconnect between what is seen as traditionally development activity and what tasks belong to operations.

Developers are improving their code, updating the user experience, and collecting new data.

Operations is tasked with keeping systems stable and secure.

Developers create change.  Operations want stability.

This creates conflict/instability.

DevOps can minimize the risk to systems while bringing updates to the system quickly.

# Five Predictors of IT Performance

1. Have a peer-reviewed change approval process

When technical teams hold themselves accountable for the quality of code through peer review, performance increases.

2. Version controll for **all** production artifacts

Version control provides a single source of truth for all changes. When changes fail it's easy to identify the cause and roll back to the last good state.  This reduces the time for recovery.

Organizations using version control for both system and application configurations have higher IT performance.

3. Proactive monitoring with baseines

Teams that practice proactive monitoring are able to diagnose and solve problems fast and have a high degree of accountability.  This creates trust.

4. High-trust organizational culture

High-trust cultures have better performance than those based on bureaucracy and fear.

5. Win-win relationship between Development and Operations

IT ops teams no longer need to “protect” their command and control function. 

Developers can stop fighting to get updates/changes pushed to production.
